# :wave: Hey, we are Almakers!

At Alma, we put finance at the service of commerce by allowing merchants to increase their sales by 20% on average. With Alma, the customer pays later, but the merchant gets paid right away with no risk taken.

📍 We are [already deployed](https://almapay.com/global) in 🇫🇷 France, 🇧🇪 Belgium, 🇩🇪 Germany, 🇪🇸 Spain, 🇮🇹 Italy and 🇱🇺 Luxemburg.
